 Marcel: Do you want me over here?

Marcel: Thank you for being here.

Marcel: Thanks for having me.

Marcel: Henrik, can you just start, give us a very short round, how do you and Fred know each other?

Henrik: So Fred and I have been friends and worked together briefly back in 2006-7.

Henrik: I was working on a documentary about copyright.

Henrik: Fred was working at a non-profit called Creative Commons, the licensing system that underpins things like Wikipedia.

Henrik: And so we were in this group of people that were very idealistic about the internet, and have stayed friends ever since.

**Henrik:** Do you want me over here?

**Marcel:** Yeah that's perfect.  Nice to meet you, Fred.  Very nice to meet you.  Thank you for being here.

**Fred:** Thanks for having me.

**Marcel:** Henrik, can you just start, give us a very short round, how do you and Fred know each other?

**Henrik:** So Fred and I have been friends and worked together briefly back in 2006-7.  I was working on a documentary about copyright.
Fred was working at a non-profit called Creative Commons, the licensing system that underpins things like Wikipedia.
And so we were in this group of people that were very idealistic about the internet, and have stayed friends ever since.

**Marcel:** That's perfect.  And you've been hanging around in Copenhagen for a couple of days?

**Fred:** Yeah, I got here a week ago, I guess.  And then I went to Sweden for a bit, but Henrik's given me an incredible tour.  We went mushroom hunting on Friday, and that was amazing.  And then I'm going to... In which forest was that?

**Marcel:** Sysvile.

**Fred:** Sysvile, yeah.  Yeah, it was wonderful.  We got lots of chanterelles, but what was the Danish name for them?  Cantareller.  Cantareller, yeah.  They were amazing.  We cooked them that night.  Are they good?  Yeah, they were great.

**Marcel:** Ah, okay, perfect.  And do you sleep on Henrik's sofa?

**Fred:** No, he's got an incredible guest room.  It was a lovely, it's been a lovely stay.

**Henrik:** Som Fred fortæller her, så er han i København for at besøge mig.  Vi er gamle venner.  Vi har været ude og samlet svampe.  Og han bor i mit gæsteverelse i vores hus.

**Marcel:** Enough with the hygge and Denmark, you've worked with artificial intelligence for so many years, first at Kickstarter, then at Y Combinator, we'll get back to that in a minute.  What were you trying to accomplish with AI within your career?

**Fred:** So I took a really interesting class in grad school by somebody named Dan Schiffman, courseware, he's a great teacher, and I think the class was called "Creative Coding." It was taught in Processing, which is a language based on Java.
Fred studied at the university and wrote code.  He was interested in, among other things, a course he took at the university, how spam filters work, and how to use algorithms and mathematical analysis of text.  He basically learned to write things that could figure out whether an email was in order or not.

**Fred:** I took on a nights and weekends project at Kickstarter where I was like, we're getting all these incoming projects and most of them are good.  And, you know, we're trying to, in the early days, decide which ones were a Kickstarter project and which ones weren't a Kickstarter project.  And they took this very seriously.  It was like, it has to be a creative project.  You can't raise money for your vacation.  It has to be for a documentary.  So people would come up with funny ways to do that.

**Henrik:** Fred had a hobby project besides his work where he tried to make an artificial intelligence that could scan the many.  Suddenly Kickstarter became big and very popular and they had to find a way to automatically find out which projects were probably Kickstarter projects and which were to be chosen.

**Fred:** So I had a friend who worked at Y Combinator and he said, well, We're interested in doing something similar with it with an algorithm so that it looks at incoming people who are applying to Y Combinator Would you be interested in working on that?  I was like, yeah, I mean I was always interested in living in California So I took them up on it and I moved out there and that was in 2016
So I worked a little bit on that but then I ended up kind of being part of the whole Y Combinator process and meeting there and that's how I met Sam Altman

**Marcel:** Yeah, that was just my clue.  Let's talk about Sam Altman.  Sure.  Your first meet-up with Sam Altman, what was that?

**Fred:** You know, he interviewed me when I was applying for the job at YC.  And I remember we were in a tiny room and he was rolling around on one of those hoverboards.

**Marcel:** Do you remember those?
**Fred:** A hoverboard?  It's not an actual hoverboard.  It's the one with the wheels.  Okay.  It was just very funny to be doing an interview while he was going around the room.  I was impressed.  I mean, I thought he, um, you know, we just, we stayed friendly while I worked there.  And, um, I saw him do what Henrik was talking about, which is get people to think bigger because that's, that's the risk with a startup is if you don't think big enough, then suddenly you're just talking about sleeping on couches instead of the hotel industry.  Right.  Which is a lot bigger than sleeping on couches.  And so that was kind of my first impression was like his skill was getting people to think creatively about how big a vision could be and kind of coaxing them to that point.

**Henrik:** So Fred's first meeting with Sam Altman is in 2016 for his job interview, where Sam Altman meets up on one of these electric skateboards, hoverboards, where he drives around in the room while they're having this job interview.  What catches Fred in the same way is that he is incredibly good at thinking big

**Marcel:** Try to describe him as a person.  What kind of person is he?

**Fred:** You could tell he was interested in kind of the abstract big ideas and maybe not as interested in the kind of day-to-day.
**Marcel:** A little bit like Steve Jobs, kind of.  Possibly.

**Fred:** I've never met Steve Jobs.  I've heard about him.  I've read a book or two.  But yeah, I mean, I think he was thinking as big as it could be.  And I think AI was particularly interesting for that reason, because around that time, within a couple of years,  it looked within sight to do something really big with AI.  And I think that's what attracted him.  And it wasn't surprising for me to hear that he was shifting to open AI after YC.

**Marcel:** I'd say Sam is up there with Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai from Google, the biggest tech bosses in the world.  If you had to compare him to, say, Zuckerberg, how do they differ?

**Fred:** I mean, I've only met Zuckerberg once.  And he was perfectly nice to me.  But I don't think we got along as  as well as I, for whatever reason, as well as I got along with Sam.  And I think Sam seems acutely interested in listening to the concerns people have.  I mean, if your audience is kind of interested in reading more, he did a great interview with Ezra Klein of the New York Times, which I think is worth listening to or reading.
And you can see him and Ezra going back and forth on like some of these big picture concerns.  And, you know, he had some of these comments in Congress about, OK, well, maybe you're right.  Maybe this is concerning or this is concerning.  And I think I think those are are genuine.  I also think it's in OpenAI's interest now to kind of ask some of those questions now that they've ended up dominant.  So he's also very smart and knows how to play chess really well, both literally and figuratively.

**Henrik:** Fred fortæller at Sam Altman, måske virkeligen adskiller sig mest for de andre tech-chefer ved at han faktisk bekymrer sig om hvad folk vil ha, hvad folk tænker.  Han mødte for nylig opp i kongressen i en høring om truslen for kunstig intelligens, og sagde jo at han mente at der var klare problemer  OpenAI, the folks behind ChatGPT, kicked off as a research lab.

**Fred:** I think about Oppenheimer, right?  I think about the Oppenheimer biography and I watch the movie and that technology was designed only to cause destruction, right?

**Henrik:** And it's a comparison that occurs a lot in this circle with that you developed a technology that was only to be used for death and destruction, and you are afraid that Artificial Intelligence is also on the way in that direction.

**Fred:** So I think there's this kind of impulse to build something really powerful and that's where the two projects are kind of similar.  And then you look back and you say, wow, did we unleash something terrible and is it going to destroy society?  And I mean, nuclear energy has some of the possibility of saving society, right?  I'm a big proponent of  nuclear fusion power plants and what they could mean for sustainable energy.  But obviously they cause a huge amount of destruction in Japan and that's a serious consequence.  And we live with the threat of nuclear war.  I mean, it's just a part of  our society now.  So, you know, Marcel saying, oh, I don't like that.  I'm like, well, I don't like the fact that, you know, America has thousands of nuclear warheads just ready to go all the time.  And technology isn't unambiguously good, you know?  And I think that that's something that we've had to learn as all of the world has come online and these systems have become more powerful.

**Henrik:** The comparison with Oppenheimer and nuclear power is good because we have seen that nuclear technology plays an important role.  It is in many ways a good energy source.  Phat says that he is a big supporter of fusion energy, which has some incredibly positive results.  We read an interview yesterday, back from 2016.

**Marcel:** And that's seriously frightening, but in a way also funny.  Altman says, I try not to think too much about it, but I have guns, gold, potassium, iodide, antibiotics, batteries, water, gas mask from Israeli Defense Force and a big patch of land in Big Sur I can fly to.  It really spooks me.  Yeah, I mean, the CEO of OpenAI says this.

**Fred:** I got it.  I mean, I think the instinct to prep for the future is maybe best thought of as independent from the technology that they're creating, because it's actually just a kind of engineering approach to the world.  When you build complicated systems,  You can get 80% of the way there with a straightforward design.  But when things break, it's on the edges.  It's outlier situations.  And good engineers, people who, whether it's they're thinking about the future or millions of users, they're planning for these kind of outside possibilities happening.  But is he serious saying this?

**Marcel:** Or is it kind of a joke?

**Fred:** No, I believe he has that.  I think he's being totally sincere.  So the question is, is he linking  the technology that he's working on to the idea that he needs to prep for the apocalypse.  No, I think it's just a general kind of paranoia around what's going to happen in the future.

**Henrik:** And it's very typical for these nerds that they like to prepare for all scenarios and solve problems themselves.  And that's not necessarily tied to artificial intelligence.

**Marcel:** And let's just aim for a hopeful finish here.  Make me a believer and convince me that I don't have to brace for Armageddon.  But we're heading into a bright future with AI.

**Fred:** I can't help you with the doom, man.

**Marcel:** Not the doom, but the realistic scenario, the optimistic scenario.  What would that be?

**Fred:** Well, I think it's that we continue to have humans in the loop kind of harnessing the best parts of AI and the AI is ultimately subservient to us.  And I think that's possible.  I mean, everyone who's building those systems is thinking in those terms.  I don't think there's a kind of villainous, I mean, who knows what China's doing, but like, I don't think there's a villainous CEO out there who just wants to delegate everything to the AI and make sure it has, you know, its own motivations and that kind of thing.  So the one silver lining of the companies being concentrated or the power being concentrated in these companies is that there's only really a handful of them to regulate and they have the power.  And so if OpenAI or Microsoft or Facebook, if we put pressure on them to do the right thing, set up the best practices, hopefully the fact that it's concentrated means that we can control it more.

**Henrik:** Fred's optimism about the future of AI can best be exemplified by how he works with it himself.  He has a small company where he spreads customer service, he develops the product, he does everything himself, and there he uses chatGBT to delegate work tasks so he can do this and make a deal on a crazy idea.  Perfect.  That was really fun.

**Marcel:** Fred Benenson, thank you so much for taking time talking to us.  I've heard you were going for, what, Louisiana?  Well, not the state, but the museum.  Yeah.  He's going to take the Tesla now and disappear.  Oh, he's going to take your Tesla.  Yeah, it's a good deal.  What does your wife say about you having a living husband?

**Henrik:** That's off-topic, Marcel.

**Marcel:** Henrik, we have come to Apple Podcast and Spotify, and we must of course say that we are also in DL Lyd, but more interestingly, we have also received our first application in Apple Podcast.  Yes, there is one that has given us one star.  It's just to understand.

**Henrik:** I've heard it and I think it was... I'm sure it was him who thought you spoke too much English.  Yes, I think so too.

**Marcel:** But I think it's fair enough.  He thinks it's a bad show because of that.  But I want to read a little bit from our first review.  It's written by a person called...  Molgatti.  It sounds a bit like a CIA attack from the 70s or a legendary mortadella chef.  We get five stars and the host writes, I apologize, but I do not have specific information about the DR podcast promptly, as my knowledge goes until September 2021.

**Henrik:** I think maybe you should read it properly, Marcel, because it says, as an A-language model, I cannot evaluate this podcast.  And then it says in the text, I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about this podcast, as my knowledge only goes as far as September 2021.  It is possible that it is a newer podcast or one that has not gained widespread attention within this time frame.  I recommend checking their official website or other reliable sources for more detailed and updated information about this podcast.
**Marcel:** Why did you write a review of our show with these ads?

**Henrik:** It was actually a practical joke a few hours later, because I saw that we had come up, and then I wanted to see if Apple would accept if you used the chat GPT to review it, so I wrote a prompt to chat GPT, evaluate, review, evaluate this podcast, and then I got this answer, and then I actually wrote the headline myself, because
It's a meme, a thing that people have fun about on the internet for a long time, that people who have used ChatGPT sometimes forget to remove a sentence that in English reads, as an AI language model, I cannot, and then it explains why it can't answer a question.
And there are a lot of people who have found examples of this in everything from I mean, some user references, for example, like podcasts, but also on Amazon and on Yelp in the USA.  I have also found it on some Danish websites.  And it has become such a thing that you can find on Twitter, where some bots write false tweets, often where they look a lot like dressed women.  It has become such a whole thing to find them.  I mean, specialized scientific articles have this sentence in them, and it is a way of how you can see that chat GPT has been used and therefore does not want to answer the questions.

**Marcel:** But it's super interesting that we are on our way to an internet that is read with all this AI generated crap.  Reviews are a pretty important resource in a way.  It is in the way that we as consumers orient ourselves around.  What is there to say about this product, apart from what they themselves write to the producer, right?  And the credibility that is in the reviews, it is about to be destroyed in a way.  I mean, it's probably broken.  It has been destroyed for a long time, Marcel.  I'm sorry to say it.  But what's the purpose of all these fake posts?  Except for yours, of course, which was the Troll-app.  But what's the purpose of all these fake posts?

**Henrik:** Well, I found, for example, a website that was kind of... (Output Truncated)...course, there is nothing wrong with that decision, but it is more that it is perhaps quite worrying that the company that is far ahead, perhaps, with generative AI right now, cannot develop a tool that can reveal whether what this robot has done is generated by AI or not.  So it's pretty scary in a way.  Yes, and interesting too.  How much of your racing cycles actually...

**Henrik:** I haven't bought new ones recently, so I can't deliver any very, very high rates.  Okay.  What about Tesla?  I've leased it myself.

**Marcel:** You won't get me this time.  Well, I can inform you that FTC, the Federal Trade Commission of the United States, will shut down what they call dishonest reporting practices.  For example, false reports can also be read about on The Verge.  FTC mentions the specific origin of AI chatbots as something that makes it easier to make false reports.  And the payment size can go up to $50,000.  That's a little more than my bike.  Yes, but not more than your monthly salary.

**Henrik:** Yes, it is.  But I think it's going to have a devastating effect, because it's actually the case that applications, also here in Denmark, but to an even greater extent in the USA, have been completely impossible to trust for a very, very long time.  I mean, what you call organic applications, i.e. applications that have been written by real people who are honest, have been largely useless for a long time.

**Marcel:** I'm looking forward to seeing if you get a ticket for this.  I'll be happy if it happens.  We like real applications.  So if you like the show, go to Spotify or Apple Podcasts and give us a like for every one you get.  That was episode 2 of Prompt.  I think you did a great job, Henrik.  You're very much like me.  At least I got smarter.  We're coming out every Thursday on the podcast IdeaLyd.  You can listen to it from the morning show.  I was wondering if we could meet this weekend and listen to the rest of your harddisk collection.

**Henrik:** I don't think we need that, Marcel.
